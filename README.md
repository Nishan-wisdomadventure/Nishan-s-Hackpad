# Nishan's Hackpad
This is my hackpad, which will boost my productivity by a heap.

## What my hackpad offers
- 14 completely programmable keys
- 1 rotary encoder
- An oled screen(128*32)
- Per key rgb(SK6812 MINI-E led is used)

## CAD
My case is a bit complex because I wanted to side mount the oled screen. My case assembly would have 4 parts in total. One is the main body, another one is the bottom plate, another one is a side holder for oled screen and the last one is key plate. The bottom plate fits in place with the main body using a snap fit feature. the top key plate isn't directly attached to the body yet. I think keeping that free, laying over the body won't hurt. And for the side holder that holds the oled screen, I will stick it to the main body using superglue. The parts are shown below!
